##Introduction
This is an assignment for the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data. 
Here is a link to the original research:

##Steps taken
After importing the test and training data,I added a column for Activity and Participant ID before combining both test and training in one dataframe.
I then selected just the columns relating to mean and standard deviation as that was the assignment. I did this by searching for "mean" and "standard deviation".
I then added the headings from the "features.txt" file to the dataframe.. Finally the tidy file contains a summary of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Further Information
Further information about the data can be found in the README attached to the original research.
